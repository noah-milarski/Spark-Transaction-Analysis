# Commercial Operations Analysis

This project performs various analyses on a commercial operations dataset using Apache Spark. The dataset includes transaction data such as trade value, commodity, country, and other relevant fields. The goal is to process, clean, and analyze the data using Spark's powerful distributed processing framework.

## Requirements

Before running this project, make sure to install the following dependencies:

- Apache Spark
- PySpark

To install the required libraries, use the following command:

```bash
pip install pyspark
```

# Project Overview

The analysis covers several key aspects, including:

- Handling missing values in the dataset
- Counting transactions for specific countries and years
- Summarizing trade data by commodity, country, and year
- Sorting and filtering the data to generate useful insights

## Technologies Used
